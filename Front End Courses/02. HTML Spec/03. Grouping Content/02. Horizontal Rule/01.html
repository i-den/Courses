<p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching
    time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical
    age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading
    campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a
    supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwealth could be
    appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
<p><i>Maybe it won't be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was
    comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night's
    shift.</p>

<p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the
    astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of
    doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a
    semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a
    thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and
    deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the
    observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow
    of Gralmond's winters.</p>
