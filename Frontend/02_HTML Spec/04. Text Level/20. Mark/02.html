<h3>Wormhole Physics Introduction</h3>

<p><mark>A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
    maximum of just under 39 minutes.</mark> Conditions that can increase
    the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
    the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
    black hole).</p>

<p><mark>Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
    radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
    but matter cannot.</mark></p>

<p>When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
    <strong>Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
        annihilate anything in its path.</strong> Vortexes can be avoided when
    using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.</p>

<p><mark>An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
    wormhole connection.</mark></p>
