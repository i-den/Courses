Class
   - one Class obj (created and stored in a .class file) for each class in the program
   - JVM uses class loader to create that obj
   - Classes are loaded dynamically, upon first use of a static member of that class
   - Constructors are also static
   - Class.forName() || .class
   - primitive.class = Wrapper.TYPE
   - .class does not initialize the Class object - doesn't load
